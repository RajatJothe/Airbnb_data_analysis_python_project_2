- How are listings distributed across different neighborhoods?

- What is the relationship between price and room type?

- How has the number of reviews changed over time?

## ðŸ“š Project Learning

**Technologies Used:**
**Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn**

- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates and unwanted columns.

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights related to property types, pricing patterns, and listing characteristics.

- Cleaned and transformed pricing fields by removing currency symbols and converting to numerical formats, improving the quality of pricing analysis.
